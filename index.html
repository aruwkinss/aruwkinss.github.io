<p> This is AC1. I do not really eat there because it usually really crowded. However, it provides wide range of food options which are quite affordable. </p>

<p> This is AC2. I do not really eat there as well, because offered food options are more limited. But it is not as crowded as AC1 or AC3, a perfect place for an introvert. </p>

<p> This is AC3. It is usually really crowded because it is the closest canteen for students living in halls. It also offer wide range of food, and portions are really big. I like it. &#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088&#11088;</p>
